## Hi there! 👋

I am eupthere (🗣️ ee-up-there).

I believe creativity comes from organic and explosive human experiences.

Computers do not seem to speak such uncertain languages.

As a developer, I aspire to connect humans with computers to enrich our lives.

I love creating very specific tools that meet unique needs.


## More about me

I have a background in graphic design (BA at [Hongik University](https://www.hongik.ac.kr/en/index.do), [Visual Communication Design](https://www.hongik.ac.kr/en/academics/intro-faculty-detail.do?mode=view&deptCd=AAG281&depth=3)).

3D printing is my passion. (Sometimes problem-solving needs a hardware solution ⚙️.)
I designed and printed a 10-inch server rack for my own homelab (see [picture 1](10-inch-server-rack-01.png), [picture 2](10-inch-server-rack-02.png)).
I also ran a small 3D-printed product business for half a year.

My favorite data structure is the graph.
